Difficulties break some men but make others. No axe is sharp enough to cut the soul of a sinner who keeps on trying, one armed with the hope that he will rise even in the end.

## I Wholeheartedly Believe:

* We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid.
* The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder.
* To my mathematical brain, the numbers alone make thinking about aliens perfectly rational. The real challenge is to work out what aliens might actually be like.
* Humanity is actually under the control of dinosaur-like alien reptiles called the Babylon Brotherhood who must consume human blood to maintain their human appearance.
* The Big Five publishing companies are dinosaurs trying to survive in a post-meteor world. They won't.
* You could arm-wrestle with a T. rex and win, but you shouldn't because it only makes them mad.
* I'm always trying to reach a transcendent point, a romantic point, but reach it in a really unconventional way, a really profane way. To get to that romantic, touching, heartbreaking place, but through a lot of acts of profanity.
* I believe things cannot make themselves impossible.
